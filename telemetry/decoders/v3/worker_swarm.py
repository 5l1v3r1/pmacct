# DISCLAIMER, I didn't do Python for more than 10 years before writing that code :-D
#
# This is a STRONG WARNING, it means that this code might not follow best practises in Python, and
# even worse that this code might not be do what it is supposed to do.
#
# Micro-library to do computation in a multi (thread|process) manner
#
# Python threads are spreading on multiple cores, Python processes are real
# UNIX processes that are spreading on multiple cores.
#
# This library provides two implementations:
# - WorkerSwarmMP for multi-processes version
# - WorkerSwarmMT for multi-thread version
#
# Trade-off:
# - MP tasks are a bit heavier to start and tasks distribution is a bit less efficient
# - MP tasks are really spreading on all the available CPU and therefore achieve better
#   results on multiple core.
